# Story

This is the story of a **woman** who has just finished **eating**. He is **happy**. But he didn't expect what happened to him. What awaited him was a harder afternoon.

---

**The woman** did not know how much the afternoon will be **eventful**. Firstly, she decided to do a **little nap** because she **ate too much**. A big **noise** woke her up. It was his cat. It made fall *the kitchen vase down*. The woman wakes up in distress, She didn't know yet what was waiting for her, *a thief? a friend?*

As she was living in the USA, the only right thing to do was to take her gun from above her bed and shoot in the air. The ceiling started to break into pieces and **since she ate too much, she wasn't able to run away from it**. Hopefully, the cat survived because cats are incredible ~~and probably really have nine lives~~. 
The house finally collapsed on itself with the woman in it. The cat was happy because *if there wasn't a house anymore, the broken vase didn't matter anymore*.

The cat, who was actually using his 7 lives (5 left btw), pulled off the corpse barely alive of his master. After doing chest compressions for 10 mins, he managed to save the woman , hoping that she'll give him some bones as a gift. But she didn't care and called an ambulance. The cat, angry with the lack of bones, took the phone from his master and hung up with a strict "meow"
